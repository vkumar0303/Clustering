# Clustering

# Clustering Techniques Used
# 1. K-Means Clustering
K-Means is a popular clustering algorithm that partitions data into K clusters by minimizing the distance of points from their assigned cluster centers.

The Elbow Method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

# 2. Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical clustering builds a hierarchy of clusters and can be visualized using a dendrogram.

Agglomerative Clustering is used, and it merges clusters based on distance metrics.

# 3. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)
DBSCAN clusters data based on density and is effective at finding clusters of arbitrary shape, including outliers.
